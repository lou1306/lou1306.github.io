The role of Linear Logic as an underlying structure of logic and computation is
widely acknowledged. As such, it is not only a research subject in itself, but
also a conceptual framework, offering an original and fruitful viewpoint on the
objects of logic and computer science.

This school will offer an introduction to the main concepts and essential
results in Linear Logic, based on an undergoing project to produce a reference
textbook, within the International Research Network on Linear Logic. The
lectures will be given by some of the foremost experts of the subject, involved
in that collaborative effort. The school will moreover include a lab work
session, using recently developed software to construct and manipulate Linear
Logic proofs.

In addition to the lectures, the week will be concluded by a series of tutorial
talks on a selection of advanced subjects, reflecting current research
directions involving Linear Logic.

                <p><p>BigDat 2020 Autumn will be a research training event with a global scope aiming at updating participants on the most recent advances in the critical and fast developing area of big data. Previous events were held in Tarragona, Bilbao, Bari, Timișoara, Cambridge and Ancona.</p>
<p>Big data is a broad field covering a large spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries, medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience.</p>
<p>Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely foundations, infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications (to biological and health sciences, to business, finance and transportation, to online social networks, etc.). Major challenges of analytics, management and storage of big data will be identified through 24 four-hour and a half courses, 2 keynote lectures and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.</p>
<p>An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.</p>

taking place since 1980, the Petri Net community organises every 7-10
years an Advanced Course on Petri Nets, which comprises the respective
current state of the art in Petri Net Theory and in Applications of
Petri Nets. Typical attendees are PhD students and post-docs from all
over the world who work with Petri Nets, but also more senior scientists
who want to broaden their expertise. In particular, students of an
Advanced Course on Petri Nets learn about Petri Nets as a foundation for
various application oriented process related domains. The program of the 6th
Advanced Course is application oriented i.e. directed towards aspects of
Petri Net applications, case studies and tools introduced after lectures
on fundamental issues and presentations on important new advanced topics
and results.</p>

                <p><p>Almost all modern technical systems rely crucially on software. Communication,
transportation, financial services, healthcare, power supply, military defense,
and many other aspects of modern societies require software systems that are
both safe and secure. Safe software behaves according to its specification and,
in particular, avoids hazards for the environment it is used in. Secure software
ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, even when a
system is attacked by an adversary. Both safety and security violations
potentially cause considerable economic, political, and physical damage. So,
improving our understanding of safety and security and, thereby, enhancing our
ability to construct safe and secure systems is a vital challenge for our
society.
The lectures in this summer school give an overview of the state of the art in
the construction and analysis of safe and secure systems. Starting from the
logical and semantic foundations that enable reasoning about classical software
systems, they extend to the development and verification of cyber-physical
systems, which tightly combine computational and physical components, and have
become pervasive in aerospace, automotive, industry automation, and consumer
appliances. Safety and security have traditionally been considered separate;
however, several lectures in this summer school will emphasize their
commonalities and present analysis and construction techniques that apply to
both.</p>

aiming at updating participants on the most recent advances in the
critical and fast developing area of deep learning. Previous events were
held in Bilbao, Genova and Warsaw. Renowned academics and industry
pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience. Most deep
learning subareas will be displayed, and main challenges identified
through 2 keynote lectures and 24 four-hour and a half courses, which
will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are
convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most
motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.
An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their
own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special
sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.</p>

                <p><p>Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky&rsquo;s program of
Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the
computer proof assistant Coq.
In this school and workshop, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas
of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to the
formalization of mathematics in a computer proof assistant based on
Univalent Foundations.
Participants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and
to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field. In
the accompanying problem sessions, they will formalize pieces of
univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.</p>

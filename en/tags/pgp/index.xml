      <description>With the new year comes a new daily notebook! Since I always carry it around, I typically put a lot of personal data in the first pages of the notebook in the hope that, should I lose it somewhere, it will be found and returned. This time, as I was filling in the info page, I started thinking&amp;hellip; Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if I had some other way to prove that this thing is mine, without having to provide so much information?</description>

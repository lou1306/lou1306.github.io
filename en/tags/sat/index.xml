      <description>Formal verification allows to find bugs in a program by systematically exploring all its feasible executions. I have used several formal verification tools during my PhD; since I feel there is a lack of technical blog posts about this topic on the Web, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and write some :)
This post deals with bounded model checking, specifically the CBMC tool and how to combine it with the Glucose solver. I believe this leads to a measurable increase in performance, at least when checking unsafe programs.</description>

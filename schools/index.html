                    <p>Next to the annual conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets
taking place since 1980, the Petri Net community organises every 7-10
years an Advanced Course on Petri Nets, which comprises the respective
current state of the art in Petri Net Theory and in Applications of
Petri Nets. Typical attendees are PhD students and post-docs from all
over the world who work with Petri Nets, but also more senior scientists
who want to broaden their expertise. In particular, students of an
Advanced Course on Petri Nets learn about Petri Nets as a foundation for
various application oriented process related domains. The program of the 6th
Advanced Course is application oriented i.e. directed towards aspects of
Petri Net applications, case studies and tools introduced after lectures
on fundamental issues and presentations on important new advanced topics
and results.

talents, encourage innovation And create jobs and economic prosperity.
The ‚Äúsmart city looks like‚Ä¶‚Äù summer school will provide a comprehensive
view of the technologies, concerns and assets relevant to the design of
smart cities.
Students will explore interdisciplinary approaches while working in
interdisciplinary and intercultural groups of students and lecturers in
order to analyze what smart city looks like: cities aiming to become
more energy efficient, clean and green, while addressing citizen
engagement, governance and critical needs.

                    <p>Homotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky&#39;s program of
Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the
computer proof assistant Coq.
In this school and workshop, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas
of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to the 
formalization of mathematics in a computer proof assistant based on
Univalent Foundations.
Participants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and 
to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field. In
the accompanying problem sessions, they will formalize pieces of 
univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.

aiming at updating participants on the most recent advances in the
critical and fast developing area of deep learning. Previous events were
held in Bilbao, Genova and Warsaw. Renowned academics and industry
pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience. Most deep
learning subareas will be displayed, and main challenges identified
through 2 keynote lectures and 24 four-hour and a half courses, which
will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers are
convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most
motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.
An open session will give participants the opportunity to present their
own work in progress in 5 minutes. Moreover, there will be two special
sessions with industrial and recruitment profiles.

                    <p>Software development process has been studied for long within the field
of software engineering. However, in the last two decades two events can
be identified which impacted dramatically on the unfolding of the
discipline: the advent of Agile Methods and Cloud Computing. Before a
software system was something to be analyzed, designed, programmed,
tested, released and maintained. After, these phases so neatly defined
started fading their borders. Academia and industry are currently facing
the challenges opened by the Devops approach: tools, rapid
development‚Äìdeployment processes, effects on team performance,
analytics, trustworthiness, microservices‚Ä¶ The Summer School on Software
Engineering and Continuous Development aims at discussing some of these
issues, present the current solutions and trends and put together
professionals, academics and students in an informal and productive
atmosphere.

                    <p>MOVEP is a five-day summer school on modelling and verification of
infinite state systems. It aims to bring together researchers and
students working in the fields of control and verification of concurrent
and reactive systems.
MOVEP 2020 will consist of ten invited tutorials. In addition, there
will be special sessions that allow PhD students to present their
on-going research (each talk will last around 20 minutes). Extended
abstracts (2-3 pages) of these presentations will be published in
informal proceedings.

                    <p>Computational complexity theory was born more than 50 years ago when
researchers started asking themselves what could be computed
efficiently. Classifying problems/functions with respect to the amount
of resources (e.g. time and/or space) needed to solve/compute them
turned out to be an extremely difficult question. This has led
researchers to develop a remarkable variety of approaches, employing
different mathematical methods and theories.
The future development of complexity theory will require a subtle
understanding of the similarities, differences and limitations of the
many current approaches. In fact, even though these study the same
phenomenon, they are developed today within disjoint communities, with
little or no communication between them (algorithms, logic, programming
theory, algebra...). This dispersion is unfortunate since it hinders the
development of hybrid methods and more generally the advancement of
computational complexity as a whole.
The goal (and peculiarity) of the Caleidoscope school is to reunite in a
single event as many different takes on computational complexity as can
reasonably be fit in one week.  It is intended for graduate students as
well as established researchers who wish to learn more about
neighbouring areas.

Since 2017 it is organized by the Department of Software Science.        
The main objective of EWSCS is to expose Estonian, Baltic, and Nordic
graduate students in computer science (but also interested students from
elsewhere) to frontline research topics usually not covered within the
regular curricula. The working language of the schools is English.

will also consider applications from senior undergrad and master
students who intend to continue their study in the field of

awards in mathematics and computer science, the Abel Prize, ACM A.M.
Turing Award, ACM Prize in Computing, Fields Medal and the Nevanlinna
Prize are invited to participate in the Forum. They will give lectures
on subjects of their choosing which are primarily directed at the
participating young scientists. Those lectures should be the starting
point of intensive discussions between the laureates and the young
researchers during the forum. This means that the Heidelberg Laureate
Forum is not a classical scientific conference but a networking event
meant to motivate and inspire the next generation of scientists.
Additional to the lectures there are other platforms for exchange, such
as workshops, the hot topic, poster flashes etc.

                    <p>The Summer School Marktoberdorf is a 10-day course for young computer
scientists and mathematicians working on formal approaches to
correctness and security of software systems. Software systems are part
of our lives in many forms because they are part of almost all technical
systems nowadays. Their ubiquity implies that they should satisfy
particularly high standards: they should not harm their environment
(safety) and they should not be vulnerable to security attacks.
Violations of both safety and security can result in considerable
economic, political, and physical damage. Thus the focus of the summer
school are the general improvement of the quality of complex software
systems and in particular cyber defense and new technologies to support
the construction of safe and secure information technology
infrastructure needed for a functioning modern society.

aiming at updating participants about the most recent advances in the
critical and fast developing area of deep learning. This is a branch of
artificial intelligence covering a spectrum of current exciting machine
learning research and industrial innovation that provides more efficient
algorithms to deal with large-scale data in neurosciences, computer
vision, speech recognition, language processing, human-computer
interaction, drug discovery, biomedical informatics, healthcare,
recommender systems, learning theory, robotics, games, etc. Renowned
academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with
the audience.

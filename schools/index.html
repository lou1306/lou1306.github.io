                <p><p>The Oregon Programming Languages Summer School has been devoted for twenty
years to teaching the principles of programming languages to students and
professionals. Although the topics vary from year to year, the unifying theme
is the importance of fundamental theory to the design and implementation of
programming languages, the development of program verification tools, and the
application of advanced programming languages to practice. The program takes
place over two weeks, with ample time for group and private study. The summer
school attracts participants from around the world, and is often able to
subsidize the participation of qualified attendees with limited resources.
More than a thousand participants have attended OPLSS since its inception in
2002. The summer school is sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and
by generous grants from numerous companies over the years.</p>

                <p><p>Since its inception, ergonomics has helped make technological advancement and
innovation more accessible to humankind. Recent years have seen a real paradigm
shift in the field of cognitive ergonomics, which studies the interaction
between the human cognitive system and information processing tools. As
technology develops, the creation of virtual and immersive environments
presents fresh difficulties for anybody wishing to research human-machine
interaction in these settings. The new paradigm shift relates to the study of
how the human emotional system interacts with virtual spaces, which is known as
emotional ergonomics of virtual environments. In other words, ergonomics as a
design for the body has given way to cognitive ergonomics, a design for
thinking, and then to emotional ergonomics, a design for people&rsquo;s inner states.
The Summer School on Emotional Ergonomic of Immersive Virtual Environment
(EEIVE) aims at deepening theoretical and methodological domains linked to
human-computer interaction with a specific focus on using multisensory
approaches for researching the human experience. It will include lectures and
group-work sessions led by scholars of national and international standing.</p>

and the Inria Center of Université de Rennes.</p>
<p>MOVEP is a 5-day summer school about modelling and verifying parallel
processes.
The purpose of MOVEP is to bring together researchers, students and
people from industry working in the fields of control and verification
of concurrent and reactive systems. The school seeks to offer a broad

on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Science. It has run annually since
1999 and has been held at either the University of Birmingham, the University
of Leicester, the University of Nottingham, or at the University of Sheffield.
The lectures are aimed at postgraduate/PhD students, typically in their first
or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to anyone who is
interested in learning more about mathematical computing foundations, and all
such applicants are warmly welcomed. We very much encourage students from
abroad to attend, participants from industry, and many have done so in the
past.</p>

16th September 2023 at Haus der bayerischen Landwirtschaft in Herrsching near
Munich. Its aim is to bring together young researchers in the field of
Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy. There will be an
opportunity to form ad-hoc groups working on specific projects, but also to
discuss in more general terms the vision of constructing correct programs from
proofs.</p>

                <p><p>Petri nets are the first formal model for concurrent and distributed systems,
and still today they remain a leading research and application framework. After
more than half a century of development, the field has been deepened
theoretically, and Petri nets are used to model, analyse, and build a wide
range of real-life systems with the support of a plethora of algorithmic
techniques and implemented tools.</p>
<p>Next to the annual conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets taking
place since 1980, the Petri Net community organises every 7-10 years an
Advanced Course on Petri Nets, which covers the respective current state of the
art both in Petri net theory and in applications of Petri nets. In particular,
the attendees have a unique opportunity to learn about Petri nets as a
foundation for various successful real-life applications.</p>

                <p><p>The third edition of the Summer School on Formal Methods for Cyber-Physical
Systems offers an in-depth exploration of reactive synthesis, a topic that was
already introduced in the first edition of the school. The lecturers will
provide a systematic account of the main achievements and the current trends of
research in reactive synthesis, covering both theory and applications.</p>
<p>The course will begin with an overview of the classical synthesis problem in
the finite-state setting, as originally formulated by Church and solved by
Buechi and Landweber. This introductory part will introduce the terminology of
infinite two-player games, explain the automatic construction of winning
strategies in “regular games”, and address history of the subject, discussing
extensions and open problems. From there, the course will investigate
approaches for making reactive synthesis more efficient and practical,
including techniques for solving the synthesis problem in restricted settings,
for decomposing the problem into subproblems, and for employing algorithms,
data structures, and heuristics to manage complexity. Variants of the synthesis
problem will also be explored, such as control strategies for hybrid and
distributed systems, monitor synthesis, synthesis under incomplete information,
distributed synthesis, and symmetric synthesis. The implementation of synthesis
tools will also receive significant attention, with a focus on recent advances
and applications of UPPAAL Stratego and the SYNTCOMP reactive synthesis
competition.</p>
<p>The summer school will conclude with a workshop on emerging research trends in
synthesis, monitoring, and learning, which showcases some exciting interactions
between formal methods and machine learning. Distinguished invited speakers
will lead the workshop. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage
with peers from around the world and may propose to deliver short research
talks voluntarily.</p>

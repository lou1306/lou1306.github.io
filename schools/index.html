distributed systems and programming languages. In this edition, we focus on
techniques for supporting high availability. The school combines theory and
practice. Through lectures by active researchers in the field, students will
get acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques, and the latest research
advances. Moreover, in hands-on sessions, students can also develop and
experiment with existing frameworks.</p>

16th September 2023 at Haus der bayerischen Landwirtschaft in Herrsching near
Munich. Its aim is to bring together young researchers in the field of
Foundations of Mathematics, Computer Science and Philosophy. There will be an
opportunity to form ad-hoc groups working on specific projects, but also to
discuss in more general terms the vision of constructing correct programs from
proofs.</p>

                <p><p>Petri nets are the first formal model for concurrent and distributed systems,
and still today they remain a leading research and application framework. After
more than half a century of development, the field has been deepened
theoretically, and Petri nets are used to model, analyse, and build a wide
range of real-life systems with the support of a plethora of algorithmic
techniques and implemented tools.</p>
<p>Next to the annual conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets taking
place since 1980, the Petri Net community organises every 7-10 years an
Advanced Course on Petri Nets, which covers the respective current state of the
art both in Petri net theory and in applications of Petri nets. In particular,
the attendees have a unique opportunity to learn about Petri nets as a
foundation for various successful real-life applications.</p>

                <p><p>The third edition of the Summer School on Formal Methods for Cyber-Physical
Systems offers an in-depth exploration of reactive synthesis, a topic that was
already introduced in the first edition of the school. The lecturers will
provide a systematic account of the main achievements and the current trends of
research in reactive synthesis, covering both theory and applications.</p>
<p>The course will begin with an overview of the classical synthesis problem in
the finite-state setting, as originally formulated by Church and solved by
Buechi and Landweber. This introductory part will introduce the terminology of
infinite two-player games, explain the automatic construction of winning
strategies in “regular games”, and address history of the subject, discussing
extensions and open problems. From there, the course will investigate
approaches for making reactive synthesis more efficient and practical,
including techniques for solving the synthesis problem in restricted settings,
for decomposing the problem into subproblems, and for employing algorithms,
data structures, and heuristics to manage complexity. Variants of the synthesis
problem will also be explored, such as control strategies for hybrid and
distributed systems, monitor synthesis, synthesis under incomplete information,
distributed synthesis, and symmetric synthesis. The implementation of synthesis
tools will also receive significant attention, with a focus on recent advances
and applications of UPPAAL Stratego and the SYNTCOMP reactive synthesis
competition.</p>
<p>The summer school will conclude with a workshop on emerging research trends in
synthesis, monitoring, and learning, which showcases some exciting interactions
between formal methods and machine learning. Distinguished invited speakers
will lead the workshop. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage
with peers from around the world and may propose to deliver short research
talks voluntarily.</p>

                <p><p>The Advanced Functional Programming summer school has been running for
more than ten years. We aim to educate aspiring Haskell programmers
beyond the basic material covered by many textbooks.</p>
<p>The lectures will cover several more advanced topics regarding the
theory and practice of Haskell programming, including topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>lambda calculus;</li>
<li>monads and monad transformers;</li>
<li>lazy evaluation;</li>
<li>generalized algebraic data types;</li>
<li>type families and type-level programming;</li>
<li>concurrency and parallelism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The summer school will be held in Utrecht and consists of a mix of
lectures, labs, and a busy social program.</p>

                <p><p>Led by software, the digitalization of society is one of the most critical
issues of our time that permeates a vast majority of our everyday
organizational, social, and economic activities. The scale and significance of
the transformative power in emerging technologies such as connectivity,
advanced platforms, computational power, and artificial intelligence (AI) are
unprecedented. This leads to both great opportunities and challenges. The SE4DS
summer school is an effort to provide researchers and practitioners in software
engineering with expertise to tackle the challenges while maximizing the
potential of digitalized society. In the first edition (2023), SE4DS will focus
on two disruptive technologies low-code development and AI. Prominent experts
in these technologies will provide intensive courses that will give attendees
solid theoretical and practical knowledge to put in practice within their
organization.</p>

                <p><p>The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) provides an intensive course of lectures on
the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. It has run annually since 1999, and
is hosted by the Universities of Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, and
Sheffield in rotation.</p>
<p>The lectures are aimed at PhD students, typically in their first or second year
of study. However, the school is open to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the mathematical foundations of computing, and in recent years has
seen increased participation from industry. We also very much welcome students
from abroad.</p>

                <p><p>Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Mathematics are emerging fields of
mathematics that study a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and
(dependent) type theory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky&rsquo;s
program of Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics,
based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.</p>
<p>The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked mathematics,
developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is freely available for everyone, as
an open-source project, from the web. The School will give many young
researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the UniMath library
and become contributors.</p>
<p>Participants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and to
Mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field. In the
accompanying problem sessions, participants will formalize pieces of Univalent
Mathematics in the UniMath library.</p>

applications in modeling, analysis, verification, and synthesis. This school,
the eleventh in the series, will focus on the principles and practice of formal
techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this
technology.
It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested
in studying and using formal techniques in their research. A prior background in
formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can
expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques
presented in the lectures during laboratory sessions.</p>

                <p><p>We are living the revolution of AI. AI offers enormous opportunities, but it
comes with a cost. AI-driven systems are increasingly being used in all aspects
of society to assist, or even replace human decision making. Can we trust such
systems? Every day, we use search, recommendations, personal assistants to help
in all sorts of decisions from where to dine and what movie to watch, to more
fundamental ones, such as our stance on political issues and worldwide events.
AI is widely being used by public and private bodies to assist decisions in
courts, in college admissions, and job recruitment. Issues of biased treatment,
exclusion, and unfairness are raised, with concerns exaggerated by various
cases catching the public attention.</p>
<p>The school will include tutorials, invited talks, and a panel. Students will be
actively involved through assignments, discussions, and participation in
working groups.</p>

                <p><p>The software industry is a fast-growing area of the global economy today, and
software forms an essential part of the information systems where their
intelligence is concentrated.</p>
<p>Demand for leading technical experts, qualified software developers and
architects, as well as quality assurance managers from the IT and communication
industry increases due to opening IT technology parks, rapid growth in offshore
and outsourced programming, digitalization of public services, and the needs of
private businesses.</p>
<p>This School aims at spreading and sharing knowledge of state-of-the-art
software engineering tools and techniques. Among the speakers of the School are
leading programmers and engineers from academia and industry. Participation is
free, you just need to register. The event is open to everyone: undergraduate
and postgraduate students, young specialists, researchers, etc.</p>

                <p><p>The role of Linear Logic as an underlying structure of logic and computation is
widely acknowledged. As such, it is not only a research subject in itself, but
also a conceptual framework, offering an original and fruitful viewpoint on the
objects of logic and computer science.</p>
<p>This school will offer an introduction to the main concepts and essential
results in Linear Logic, based on an undergoing project to produce a reference
textbook, within the International Research Network on Linear Logic. The
lectures will be given by some of the foremost experts of the subject, involved
in that collaborative effort. The school will moreover include a lab work
session, using recently developed software to construct and manipulate Linear
Logic proofs.</p>
<p>In addition to the lectures, the week will be concluded by a series of tutorial
talks on a selection of advanced subjects, reflecting current research
directions involving Linear Logic.</p>

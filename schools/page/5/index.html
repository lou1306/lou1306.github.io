tools)? This may seem a pipe dream, but the past decade has seen
remarkable advances in the technology required to realize it. The
DeepSpec Summer School will provide students with knowledge and
experience necessary for understanding the state of the art and for
contributing to ongoing research efforts, based on the interactive proof
assistant Coq. DSSS'20 will consist of two parts, with the first week
being devoted to introductory topics and the second week covering

of software engineering. However, in the last two decades two events can
be identified which impacted dramatically on the unfolding of the
discipline: the advent of Agile Methods and Cloud Computing. Before a
software system was something to be analyzed, designed, programmed,
tested, released and maintained. After, these phases so neatly defined
started fading their borders. Academia and industry are currently facing
the challenges opened by the Devops approach: tools, rapid
developmentâ€“deployment processes, effects on team performance,
analytics, trustworthiness, microservicesâ€¦ The Summer School on Software
Engineering and Continuous Development aims at discussing some of these
issues, present the current solutions and trends and put together
professionals, academics and students in an informal and productive
atmosphere.</p>

                <p><p>Computational complexity theory was born more than 50 years ago when
researchers started asking themselves what could be computed
efficiently. Classifying problems/functions with respect to the amount
of resources (e.g. time and/or space) needed to solve/compute them
turned out to be an extremely difficult question. This has led
researchers to develop a remarkable variety of approaches, employing
different mathematical methods and theories.
The future development of complexity theory will require a subtle
understanding of the similarities, differences and limitations of the
many current approaches. In fact, even though these study the same
phenomenon, they are developed today within disjoint communities, with
little or no communication between them (algorithms, logic, programming
theory, algebra&hellip;). This dispersion is unfortunate since it hinders the
development of hybrid methods and more generally the advancement of
computational complexity as a whole.
The goal (and peculiarity) of the Caleidoscope school is to reunite in a
single event as many different takes on computational complexity as can
reasonably be fit in one week.  It is intended for graduate students as
well as established researchers who wish to learn more about
neighbouring areas.</p>

reject racism from the systems we create and the systems within which we exist.
We know that one day of action is not enough: our goal is to both achieve small
immediate change, and to facilitate the planning of broader systemic change
across the world of programming languages research.</p>

                <p><p>The Online Worldwide Seminar on Logic and Semantics is an online-only
series of research talks, highlighting the most exciting recent work
in the international computer science logic community. In this time of
restricted international travel, a key aim of this series is to
provide a forum for informal discussion and social interaction that is
so important for the progress of science. To facilitate this, the
seminar incorporates in virtual form a number of features more
normally associated with physical meetings, including virtual &ldquo;coffee
breaks&rdquo; before and after the seminar, allowing participants to chat in
small groups. (Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your own coffee.)</p>
<p>Starting this Wednesday, we are excited to announce the first of our
OWLS Young Researcher talks, given by a researcher within 7 years of
completing their PhD. A new initiative, these OWLS-YR talks will take
place fortnightly, interleaved with regular OWLS talks. Our goal is to
give a platform to the excellent work being done by junior members of
the community. All members of the community are encouraged to attend
these talks.</p>

                <p><p>This University of Kent designed course will teach theory and practice, through
practical exercises and suggested projects and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started programming in Erlang</li>
<li>Programs and functions in Erlang</li>
<li>Data structures using lists</li>
<li>Tools for Erlang programming</li>
<li>Functions as data, and higher-order functions</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
</ul>
<p>The course is free and designed for anyone with prior programming experience,
whether self-taught or professional. This is followed in late June by a second
MOOC on Concurrent Programming in Erlang.</p>
<p>We combine the theory of functional programming and the practice of how that
works in Erlang. The course will also help you if you are interested in Elixir,
based on the same virtual machine as Erlang, and will help you get going with
any functional language.</p>
